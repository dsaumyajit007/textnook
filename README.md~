#TextNook
Textnook is a Django service that provides a REST API for prediction of the genre of a book based on it's title using a naive Bayesian classifier along with Natural Language Processing.

You are advised to build this inside a virtual environment as we use a Non-rel fork of Django to support MongoDB.

You may install and setup both your virtual environment and all the other necessary programs from [here](http://django-mongodb-engine.readthedocs.org/en/latest/topics/setup.html) and then clone this project.

After cloning, change your path to this directory and execute
python manage.py runserver
